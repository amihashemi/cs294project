abstract = {An efficient numerical technique is presented for solving the reduced system of equations for reacting flow in the zero Mach number limit. The technique is based on the projection method which had been developed to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow, modified to account for the non-zero divergence of the velocity. The technique is second-order accurate in both space and time. Calculations are presented for reacting flow in a closed container.},
